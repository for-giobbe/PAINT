## Weighted Gene Coexpression Network in crema

Here a different approach than the one used for vicia will be leveraged, due to the multiple tissues / conditions. 

---

Nonetheless the initial steps are different to those carried out for vicia. Transcript abundance can be obtained 
using the script ```slurm_abundances_crema``` which also uses bowtie and RSEM.

After that the expression matrices can be generated by:

```
```

after moving the outputs to the right place with ```mv RSEM_vicia.* abundances/vicia/``` we can take a look at the outputs:


```
```

*NB:* while for DE analyses we used the raw gene-counts matrix as input, WGCNA requires allready normalized counts
and se will leverage TMM-normalized TPMs.
