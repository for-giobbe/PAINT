## Weighted Gene Coexpression Network in crema

Here a different approach than the one used for vicia will be leveraged, due to the multiple tissues / conditions. 


---


Nonetheless the initial steps are different to those carried out for vicia. Transcript abundance can be obtained 
using the script ```slurm_abundances_crema``` which also uses bowtie and RSEM.

After that the expression matrices can be generated by:

```
```

after moving the outputs to the right place with ```mv RSEM_vicia.* abundances/vicia/``` we can take a look at the outputs:


```
```

*NB:* while for DE analyses we used the raw gene-counts matrix as input, WGCNA requires allready normalized counts
and se will leverage TMM-normalized TPMs.  

```
library(edgeR)

> GenewiseCounts <- read.delim("GSE60450_Lactation-GenewiseCounts.txt.gz", row.names="EntrezGeneID")
colnames(GenewiseCounts) <- substring(colnames(GenewiseCounts),1,7)

> y <- DGEList(GenewiseCounts[,-1], group=group, genes=GenewiseCounts[,1,drop=FALSE])
options(digits=3)

y <- calcNormFactors(y)
y$samples
```
