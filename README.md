This repository contains all the code used to study the molecular groundplan of a plant-ant interaction.


Most of the code was generated for RNA-seq of the plant _Vicia faba_ and the ant _Crematogaster scutellaris_.


In here _Vicia faba_ will be reverenced as **vicia** and _Crematogaster scutellaris_ as **crema**.


Experiment reads have been deposited under the BioProject **PRJNA758979**.


Additionaly, metagenomics of the plant surface and protemoics of its EFN have been performed.


This is WIP:


- [**part 0**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_0.md) - setting up the environiments

- [**part 1**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_1.md) - reads qc & pre-processing

- [**part 2**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_2.md) - trascriptomes assembly, annotation and filtering

- [**part 3**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_3.md) - expression analyses in vicia

- [**part 4**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_4.md) - expression analyses in crema

- [**part 5**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_5.md) - GO/KO annotation and enrichment

- [**part 6**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_6.md) - phylostratigrapy and evolutionary rates

- [**part 7**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_7.md) - addendum 1 - metagenomics

- [**part 8**](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_8.md) - addendum 2 - proteomics
