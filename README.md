This repository contains all the code used to study the molecular groundplan of a plant-ant interaction.


Most of the code was generated for RNA-seq of the ant _Crematogaster scutellaris_ and the plant _Vicia faba_.


Additionaly, metagenomics of leaf lamina and and proteomics of extra-floral nectar have been performed.


In here _Vicia faba_ will be reverenced as **vicia** and _Crematogaster scutellaris_ as **crema**.


Experiment reads have been deposited under the BioProject **PRJNA758979**.
