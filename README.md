**PAINT** - **Plant** **A**nt **INT**eraction

---

This repository contains all the code used to study the molecular greoundplan of a plant-ant interaction.


Two separate RNA-seq experiments were generated for the plant _Vicia faba_ and the ant _Crematogaster scutellaris_.

In here _Vicia faba_ will be reverenced as vicia and _Crematogaster scutellaris_ as crema.

RNA-seq reads and assemblies have been deposited under the BioProject **PRJNA758979**.

This is WIP:

- [part 0](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_0.md) - setting the environiment & downloading the reads

- [part 1](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_1.md) - reads qc & pre-processing

- [part 2]() - trascriptome assembly, annotation and filtering
