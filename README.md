This repository contains all the code used to study the molecular groundplan of a plant-ant interaction.

Two RNA-seq experiments were generated for the plant _Vicia faba_ and the ant _Crematogaster scutellaris_.

In here _Vicia faba_ will be reverenced as **vicia** and _Crematogaster scutellaris_ as **crema**.

RNA-seq reads and assemblies have been deposited under the BioProject **PRJNA758979**.


This is WIP:

- [part 0](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_0.md) - setting the environiment & downloading the reads

- [part 1](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_1.md) - reads qc & pre-processing

- [part 2](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_2.md) - trascriptome assembly, annotation and filtering

- [part 3](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_3.md) - gene Differential Expression analysis in Vicia

- [part 4](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_4.md) - Weighted Gene Coexpression Network in Crema

- [part 5](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_5.md) - GO enrichment analyses

- [part 6](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/blob/main/markdowns/part_6.md) - phylostratigrapy and evolutionary rates
